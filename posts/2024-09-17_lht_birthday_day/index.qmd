# Birthday Days

I have a largish family. At last count, I believe I had something in the order of fifteen nieces and nephews (to give you an indication). When my girls and I drive to the family farm (yes, we have a family farm and, yes, you should be jealous because, yes, it is dope), various siblings of mine descend on the farm with their many children in-tow.

On one such occasion, a nephew of mine said a curious thing. We were discussing birthdays and he said some like "My birthday is always on Saturday or Sunday". Now, being only eight or so at the time, I suppose it is forgivable that he thought thisâ€“perhaps his last couple of birthdays were on these days and the rest were simply too far distant to remember. But it got me wondering: how do birthday days fall year-to-year?
