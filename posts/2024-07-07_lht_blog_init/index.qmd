### Remember spiral notebooks?

I've used spiral notebooks throughout my whole school career but it took me an embarrassingly long period of time to realize something about them: only the right-hand side is worth a damn. In terms of legibility, that is. I'm a righty, so writing down notes on the left-hand side meant that my hand rested on the spiral itself for roughly half of each class period. I. HATED. IT.

So, I ended up only writing notes on the right-hand side of my spirals. This worked, but then I had a whole blank page to deal with. What did I do with this unexpected windfall of college-ruled wonderland of possibilities? Doodled. Mostly. I also wrote down interesting thoughts, not always related to the lecture I was listening toâ€”interesting to me at least. Thus, the left-hand side of the spiral took on a new life. It became where all of the interesting things went. Or perhaps just ideas that I wanted to evict from my brain (where they had been living rent-free). Either way, the "left-hand thoughts" turned out to be the most interesting parts of those spirals.

### Fast forward to today...

Not being in school anymore, I don't use spirals hardly at all. My hope for this blog is that I'll be able to capture the spirit of these left-hand thoughts (LHTs) in a more fully explored format. These will probably focus more on coding and statistics (the very lame topics that occupy my mental left-hand side of my mental spiral nowadays). But there may be some other topics of interest in the future as well. We'll just need to see how things go...

That's it for now! Cheers, everybody.
