    "text": "Remember spiral notebooks?\nI’ve used spiral notebooks throughout my whole school career but it took me an embarrassingly long period of time to realize something about them: only the right-hand side is worth a damn. In terms of legibility, that is. I’m a righty, so writing down notes on the left-hand side meant that my hand rested on the spiral itself for roughly half of each class period. I. HATED. IT.\nSo, I ended up only writing notes on the right-hand side of my spirals. This worked, but then I had a whole blank page to deal with. What did I do with this unexpected windfall of college-ruled wonderland of possibilities? Doodled. Mostly. I also wrote down interesting thoughts, not always related to the lecture I was listening to—interesting to me at least. Thus, the left-hand side of the spiral took on a new life. It became where all of the interesting things went. Or perhaps just ideas that I wanted to evict from my brain (where they had been living rent-free). Either way, the “left-hand thoughts” turned out to be the most interesting parts of those spirals.\n\n\n\nSpiral notebook from… doctorate? Notice the LHT, something about the ocean as a metaphor for the multiverse and fate. I have no idea where I was going with that…\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to today…\nNot being in school anymore, I don’t use spirals hardly at all. My hope for this blog is that I’ll be able to capture the spirit of these left-hand thoughts (LHTs) in a more fully explored format. These will probably focus more on coding and statistics (the very lame topics that occupy my mental left-hand side of my mental spiral nowadays). But there may be some other topics of interest in the future as well. We’ll just need to see how things go…\nThat’s it for now!

    "text": "My name is Peter Tanksley, I’m a biosocial criminologist studying social science genetics/epigenetics at UT Austin research scientist at the ALERRT Center, Texas State University. This website is pretty boring right now but I plan to use it to host me-related information, materials, and (one day) a blog (“Left Hand Thoughts”).\nUntil I get things moving, I’d like to leave this image up as an illustration of how I (and many biosocial researchers like me) view their work. This image was taken from the cover of Douglas Hofstadter’s “Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid”, a wonderful book about the origins of consciousness (at least, that was what I got from the 1/5 of the book that I managed to read in grad school before getting distracted by some world-ending assignment or other).\n\n\n\nCover image from “Gödel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid” by Douglas Hofstadter\n\n\nBut I have always found the image to be arresting and, if you imagine the letters to mean something other than the initials of the book’s title, also an apt visual depiction of how the key forces of biosocial research are interrelated (and interdependent). Imagine the letters stand for “Genes”, “Environment”, and “Behavior”. Most research paradigms make use of only two of the three, and they typically prioritize one in particular. For example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically study genes and behavior (using the term very loosely), while assuming that the environments of the participants are exchangeable (i.e., they have no impact on the outcome). Of course, the people running these studies don’t really believe that to be the case, but it is a tacit assumption that many of those models make. In contrast, my perspective is that by leveraging multiple research paradigms and being as interdisciplinary as is practical, I can gain some kind of purchase on the colossal social issues that interest all social scientists (e.g., crime, poverty, health). As regards this image, think of a biosocial researcher as someone who is shifting the light source around this puzzling structure–suspended by mysterious means–and asking….\n\nWhat appears to be important if I look at it this way?\nWhat if I shift the light over here–what matters now?\nWhat if I use two lights at once?\n\nAnd so on, and so on, until a better understanding is gleaned.\nOk, that’s it for now! I hope to post more later on but for now, Bon voyage!"

    "text": "I have a largish family. At last count, I believe I had something in the order of fifteen nieces and nephews (to give you an indication). When my girls and I drive to the family farm (yes, we have a family farm and, yes, you should be jealous because, yes, it is dope), various siblings of mine descend on the farm with their many children in-tow.\nOn one such occasion, a nephew of mine said a curious thing. We were discussing birthdays and he said some like “My birthday is always on Saturday or Sunday”. Now, being only eight or so at the time, I suppose it is forgivable that he thought this–perhaps his last couple of birthdays were on these days and the rest were simply too far distant to remember. But it got me wondering: how do birthday days fall year-to-year?\nA simple enough question, but as I thought about it I realized that I didn’t know anything about the subject. I had never thought about it! Now, obviously I could have simply Google’d my way into some higher state of enlightenment. But where’s the fun in that? I sensed that I had the tools in R toolkit to answer this question with logic alone (and who doesn’t like going the extra mile when it means you get to play with a new puzzle?).\nSo, as the Joker once said: “Here. We. Go.”"

Let’s see… I need to find out what day of the week a specific calendar date falls on across multiple years. So let’s pick a fictitious birthday to start (can’t be sharin’ my real deets on the interwebs). Let’s go with January 30th, 2000. Ok, how we’re ready to generate some data on all of the years moving forward!\n\nbday_data &lt;- tibble(year = seq(2000, 2024),\n                    month = 1, \n                    day = 30)\nglimpse(bday_data)\n\nRows: 25\nColumns: 3\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010…\n$ month &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ day   &lt;dbl&gt; 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, …\n\n\nSweet! We’ve got our basic data with repeated day/month values across years. Now, in order to move the investigation forward, we’ll want to create some date columns using the {lubidate} package. This will help later on I’m sure…\n\nbday_data &lt;- bday_data |&gt; \n  mutate(bday = ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = \" \")),\n         wday = wday(bday, label=TRUE))\n\nmutate: new variable 'bday' (Date) with 25 unique values and 0% NA\n\n\n        new variable 'wday' (ordered factor) with 7 unique values and 0% NA\n\nglimpse(bday_data)\n\nRows: 25\nColumns: 5\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010…\n$ month &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ day   &lt;dbl&gt; 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, …\n$ bday  &lt;date&gt; 2000-01-30, 2001-01-30, 2002-01-30, 2003-01-30, 2004-01-30, 200…\n$ wday  &lt;ord&gt; Sun, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon,…\n\n\nI added two variables. The first is a for real for real date variable (“bday”). Basically, this variable has special metadata attached to it that allows for lots of convenient calculations; it’s not just a string. The second variable, “wday”, was the day of the week for the date variable “bday”. I chose to include labels too, and it gave me back a nicely ordered factor-esque variable (so convenient! Thank you, {lubridate}!)."

Ok, so there are definitely some patterns here. It looks like there are four-year stretches of consecutive days of the week for the birthday day. So, if my birthday was on a Wednesday last year, it would be Thursday this year, Friday the following year, and Saturday the year after that (assuming last year was the start of the four-year stretch)!\nBut the pattern is only four years long, after which it skips a day of the week, and then starts a new four year stretch. Interesting. I’m pretty sure I know what’s going on, but before we sleuth any further, let’s clean up this plot some.\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, fct_rev(wday))) + #reversed the order of the y-axis\n  geom_tile(fill=\"dodgerblue\") + #added nice color\n  labs(x=element_blank(), #dropped axis titles (they're pretty obvious anyway)\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() + #picked a better theme\n  coord_fixed(expand = F) #made the tiles square\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is nicer, but I want to avoid having tiles floating in air.

Now let’s try the plot again.\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, wday)) +\n  geom_tile(fill=\"dodgerblue\") +\n  labs(x=element_blank(),\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_fixed(expand = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDamn. We need to isolate our specific birthday days again. Hang on…\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, wday)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=ifelse(!is.na(day), \"dodgerblue\", \"grey\")), \n            show.legend = F,\n            color=\"grey20\") +\n  labs(x=element_blank(),\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_fixed(expand = F) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2024)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk! Now we’re cooking with gas! Couple things I did there. First, I used a conditional argument in the aes() call (I can’t tell you how handy that trick is). Sometimes it’s better to have the result of the conditional hard-coded into your dataset if its information value is high. But we’re exploring here, so no biggie. Second, I adjusted the x-axis labels. I generally don’t like have labels that need to be angled in order to be legible, but this is not too egregious."

    "text": "Remember spiral notebooks?\nI’ve used spiral notebooks throughout my whole school career but it took me an embarrassingly long period of time to realize something about them: only the right-hand side is worth a damn. In terms of legibility, that is. I’m a righty, so writing down notes on the left-hand side meant that my hand rested on the spiral itself for roughly half of each class period. I. HATED. IT.\nSo, I ended up only writing notes on the right-hand side of my spirals. This worked, but then I had a whole blank page to deal with. What did I do with this unexpected windfall of college-ruled wonderland of possibilities? Doodled. Mostly. I also wrote down interesting thoughts, not always related to the lecture I was listening to—interesting to me at least. Thus, the left-hand side of the spiral took on a new life. It became where all of the interesting things went. Or perhaps just ideas that I wanted to evict from my brain (where they had been living rent-free). Either way, the “left-hand thoughts” turned out to be the most interesting parts of those spirals.\n\n\n\nSpiral notebook from… doctorate? Notice the LHT, something about the ocean as a metaphor for the multiverse and fate. I have no idea where I was going with that…\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to today…\nNot being in school anymore, I don’t use spirals hardly at all. My hope for this blog is that I’ll be able to capture the spirit of these left-hand thoughts (LHTs) in a more fully explored format. These will probably focus more on coding and statistics (the very lame topics that occupy my mental left-hand side of my mental spiral nowadays). But there may be some other topics of interest in the future as well. We’ll just need to see how things go…\nThat’s it for now!

    "text": "I have a largish family. At last count, I believe I had something in the order of fifteen nieces and nephews (to give you an indication). When my girls and I drive to the family farm (yes, we have a family farm and, yes, you should be jealous because, yes, it is dope), various siblings of mine descend on the farm with their many children in-tow.\nOn one such occasion, a nephew of mine said a curious thing. We were discussing birthdays and he said something like “My birthday is always on Saturday or Sunday”. Now, being only eight or so at the time, I suppose it is forgivable that he thought this–perhaps his last couple of birthdays were on these days and the rest were simply too far distant to remember at his age. But it got me wondering: how do “birthday days” fall year-to-year?\nA simple enough question, but as I thought about it I realized that I didn’t know anything about the subject. I had never thought about it! Now, obviously I could have simply Google’d my way into some higher state of enlightenment. But where’s the fun in that? I sensed that I had the tools in R toolkit to answer this question with logic alone (and who doesn’t like going the extra mile when it means you get to play with a new puzzle?).\nSo, as the Joker once said: “Here. We. Go.”"

Let’s see… I need to find out what day of the week a specific calendar date falls on across multiple years. So let’s pick a fictitious birthday to start (can’t be sharin’ my real deets on the interwebs). Let’s go with January 30th, 2000. Ok, how we’re ready to generate some data on all of the years moving forward!\n\nbday_data &lt;- tibble(year = seq(2000, 2024),\n                    month = 1, \n                    day = 30)\nglimpse(bday_data)\n\nRows: 25\nColumns: 3\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010…\n$ month &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ day   &lt;dbl&gt; 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, …\n\n\nSweet! We’ve got our basic data with repeated day/month values across years. Now, in order to move the investigation forward, we’ll want to create some date columns using the {lubidate} package. This will help later on I’m sure…\n\nbday_data &lt;- bday_data |&gt; \n  mutate(bday = ymd(paste(year, month, day, sep = \" \")),\n         wday = wday(bday, label=TRUE))\nglimpse(bday_data)\n\nRows: 25\nColumns: 5\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010…\n$ month &lt;dbl&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1…\n$ day   &lt;dbl&gt; 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, …\n$ bday  &lt;date&gt; 2000-01-30, 2001-01-30, 2002-01-30, 2003-01-30, 2004-01-30, 200…\n$ wday  &lt;ord&gt; Sun, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon,…\n\n\nI added two variables. The first is a for real for real date variable (“bday”). Basically, this variable has special metadata attached to it that allows for lots of convenient calculations; it’s not just a string. The second variable, “wday”, was the day of the week for the date variable “bday”. I chose to include labels too, and it gave me back a nicely ordered factor-esque variable (so convenient! Thank you, {lubridate}!)."

Ok, so there are definitely some patterns here. It looks like there are four-year stretches of consecutive days of the week for the birthday day. So, if my birthday was on a Wednesday last year, it would be Thursday this year, Friday the following year, and Saturday the year after that (assuming last year was the start of the four-year stretch)!\nBut the pattern is only four years long, after which it skips a day of the week, and then starts a new four year stretch. Interesting. I’m pretty sure I know what’s going on, but before we sleuth any further, let’s clean up this plot some.\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, fct_rev(wday))) + #reversed the order of the y-axis\n  geom_tile(fill=\"dodgerblue\") + #added nice color\n  labs(x=element_blank(), #dropped axis titles (they're pretty obvious anyway)\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() + #picked a better theme\n  coord_fixed(expand = F) #made the tiles square and removed gap between tile and axis line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is nicer, but I want to avoid having tiles floating in air.

Now let’s try the plot again.\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, fct_rev(wday))) +\n  geom_tile(fill=\"dodgerblue\") +\n  labs(x=element_blank(),\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_fixed(expand = F)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhoops! That didn’t work. We need to isolate our specific birthday days again. Hang on…\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, fct_rev(wday))) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=ifelse(!is.na(day), \"dodgerblue\", \"grey90\")), #conditional fill\n            show.legend = F, #no legend\n            color=\"grey20\") +\n  labs(x=element_blank(),\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_fixed(expand = F) +\n  scale_fill_identity() + #take fill colors directly from conditional fill\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2024)) + #x-axis label for every year\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) #tilt x-axis label\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOk! Now we’re cooking with gas! Couple things I did there. First, I used a conditional argument in the aes() call (I can’t tell you how handy that trick is). Sometimes it’s better to have the result of the conditional hard-coded into your dataset if its information value is high. But we’re exploring here, so no biggie. Second, I adjusted the x-axis labels. I generally don’t like have labels that need to be angled in order to be legible, but this is not too egregious."

So, let’s bring that information into our dataset and plot!\n\nbday_data &lt;- bday_data |&gt; \n  mutate(lyear = leap_year(year))\nglimpse(bday_data)\n\nRows: 175\nColumns: 6\n$ year  &lt;int&gt; 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2001, 2001, 2001, 2001…\n$ wday  &lt;ord&gt; Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri,…\n$ month &lt;dbl&gt; 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n$ day   &lt;dbl&gt; 30, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 30, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ bday  &lt;date&gt; 2000-01-30, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 2001-01-30, NA, NA,…\n$ lyear &lt;lgl&gt; TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, F…\n\n\nThanks again to the {lubridate} package (should really have made them today’s sponsor…), we have a lovely logical variable “lyear” that let’s us know if a specific year was a leap year. Now to update the plot!\n\nbday_data |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(year, fct_rev(wday))) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=case_when((!is.na(day)) ~ \"dodgerblue\", #switched to case_when()\n                               (is.na(day) & lyear==TRUE) ~ \"brown4\",\n                               (is.na(day) & lyear==FALSE) ~ \"grey90\",)), \n            show.legend = F,\n            color=\"grey20\") +\n  labs(x=element_blank(),\n       y=element_blank()) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  coord_fixed(expand = F) +\n  scale_fill_identity() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2000, 2024)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at that plot! It says it all! Four-year consecutive birthday days, skips one day because of those dastardly leap years, and then continues on for four more blissful years of predictable birthday days. What more could you want in a plot?\n(oh god, is he going to go the extra mile? he knows no one cares, right? there are no grades here, just longer blog posts that no one will ever read. oh shit, here he goes!)"
